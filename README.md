## AlgoArb
A project to highlight arbitrage opportunities on decentralised exchanges (DEXes) built on the [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com) network.

Also a chance for me to get some experience interacting with blockchain technologies.

As of now, [tinyman](https://tinyman.org) is the only DEX on Algorand, so currently I just compare ALGO and YLDY to their USD price, obtained from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com).
```
algoArb $ python3 arb.py YLDY ALGO
YLDY per ALGO USD Price: 91.09829506037015
YLDY per ALGO tinyman: 92.7252628596883
Selling 9.435357 ALGO for 874.895958 YLDY on tinyman
Buying 9.603867530344154 ALGO for 874.895958 YLDY with USD
Returns: 1.786%

```
