## AlgoArb
A project to highlight arbitrage opportunities on decentralised exchanges (DEXes) built on the [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com) network.

Also a chance for me to get some experience interacting with blockchain technologies.

As of now, [tinyman](https://tinyman.org) is the only DEX on Algorand, so currently I just compare to the USD price, obtained from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com).
```
algoArb $ python3 algoArb.py YLDY ALGO
YLDY per ALGO USD Price: 95.7278295249913
YLDY per ALGO tinyman: 94.176117
Buy YLDY on USD with ALGO, sell YLDY on tinyman for ALGO. Returns: 1.6477%
```
