## AlgoArb
A project to highlight arbitrage opportunities on decentralised exchanges (DEXes) built on the [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com) network.

Also a chance for me to get some experience interacting with blockchain technologies.

As of now, [tinyman](https://tinyman.org) is the only DEX on Algorand, so currently I just compare ALGO and YLDY to their USD price, obtained from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com).
```
